# Refund Policy

We value your satisfaction and strive to provide quality service. Please note the following policy regarding refunds and returns:

## Refund Requests

Refund requests must be submitted within 24 hours of the original purchase. Requests made after this timeframe are not eligible for a refund.

## Return Requests

Return requests must be made within 14 days of purchase. The product must be shipped back to us at your own expense. Once we receive the returned item, only 50% of the original purchase amount will be refunded to your original payment method.

To be eligible for a return, the item must be in its original condition with all cords, accessories, and packaging included. Please visit our Support Page to begin your return process.

If your request is approved, you will receive a confirmation email within 3 business days containing our return address.

## Return Requirements

All returned items must be:
- In original, undamaged condition (no liquid contamination, physical or cosmetic damage)
- Accompanied by the original Order ID, packaging, and accessories
- Securely packaged to prevent damage or loss in transit

The original Order ID and your return address must be clearly visible on the outer packaging. All postage must be prepaid, and you must use a trackable shipping method. We are not responsible for any loss or damage during return shipping. If a product is returned without a visible Order ID, it may be returned to you unopened.

Refunds are issued in the original order currency and credited to your original payment method. We are not responsible for any transaction fees you may incur. Please allow up to 7 business days after receiving your return for the refund to be processed.

## Replacement of Components

We do not offer replacements for components or accessories that are:
- Misplaced
- Lost
- Damaged by the customer after delivery

Customers are strongly advised to:
- Inspect the package carefully upon delivery
- Ensure all components are included

If any components are missing upon delivery:
- You must notify us within 48 hours of receiving the package
- Failure to do so may result in ineligibility for a resolution

Thank you for understanding our policy and supporting our business.
